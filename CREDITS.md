## Credits

Various people and projects, who have provided inspiration and ideas for getting the V10 firmware project off the ground!

* Tinfever, for their BMS firmware for Dyson V6/V7 batteries, showing that it can be done!
Their project is [here](https://github.com/tinfever/FU-Dyson-BMS)

* The bq769x0 arduino library, showing how to talk to the BMS chip (in particular the CRC functionality)
Their project is [here](https://github.com/LibreSolar/bq769x0-arduino-library/)

* Jeremy Bentham, who wrote a really helpful [blog post](https://iosoft.blog/2019/01/28/raspberry-pi-openocd/) with information about how to use the Raspberry Pi to as a programmer with OpenOCD

* Residents of the #openocd IRC channel, who provided help and guidance about how to patch OpenOCD to get SAMD20 security bit unlock functionality working.

Many thanks!
